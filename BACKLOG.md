# MatrixDesktop Backlog

## v1.0 — Completed

These features shipped in v1.0.0:

- GitHub Actions CI + Release workflows (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `release.yml`).
- `--help-full` opens an embedded argument reference (`<EmbeddedResource>` in both EXEs).
- Configurator live preview window — debounced live update of a second WebView2.
- `SystemEvents.SessionSwitch` + `PowerModeChanged` → WebView2 `TrySuspendAsync`/`Resume`.
- Dark/light theme toggle in the configurator (persisted in `ConfiguratorState.UiTheme`).
- Out-of-range numeric input validation feedback (red border + allowed-range hint).
- "Export .ps1" button → `CommandBuilder.BuildPowerShellScript` → clipboard.
- Crash dump writer: `Shared/CrashDumpWriter.cs`, MiniDumpWriteDump + unhandled-exception
  handlers, writes to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\MatrixDesktop\dumps\`.

## Future Features (deferred)

These were considered for v1.0 but moved to a future release:

- **Hot-reload window icon** — declined; the window icon is rarely visible since
  the app runs borderless-fullscreen.
- **First-run wizard** — declined; the configurator's discoverability story is
  already covered by the new `?` button + help modal.
- **Gist sync of presets** — dropped from v1.0 (OAuth/token storage too much
  scope for an initial v1). Revisit with a Personal-Access-Token approach if
  user demand surfaces.
- **Multi-config "profile" support** (`--profile work`/`--profile home`) — declined.
- **Native rendering path** — declined; WebView2 stays the canonical renderer.
- **OBS/Spout/NDI integration** — backlogged for a future release.
- **Community preset marketplace** — backlogged.
- **Per-monitor argument overrides** — backlogged. Would either ship as a
  configurator-generated `.bat` (multi-process) or require the wrapper to
  spawn its own child instances; non-trivial scope.

## Historical entries (kept for context)

### Standalone Argument Configurator

Status: Implemented; needs Windows runtime smoke testing

## Summary

Build a second executable, `MatrixDesktopConfigurator.exe`, that opens a WebView-based configuration UI for MatrixDesktop arguments. The configurator exposes desktop wrapper flags and visualizer web flags, groups controls by practical theme, shows the generated launch command live, and launches MatrixDesktop with the current draft through a safe `Test Argument` button.

The configurator supports named presets in a dropdown and restores the last draft on relaunch. Presets are stored in a portable JSON file beside the executable when possible, with an AppData fallback.

## Key Changes

- Add a separate WinForms/WebView2 project that publishes beside `MatrixDesktop.exe`.
- Add argument metadata and command generation for app flags, versions, effects, layout, motion, colors, palettes, stripes, image, mirror/camera, click ripples, and advanced toggles.
- Generate concise commands by default, containing only values changed from defaults.
- Add named preset actions: New, Save, Save As, Rename, Delete.
- Add guarded randomization scopes: Visual preset, Colors only, and Motion/Layout.
- Add command import so an existing MatrixDesktop command or argument line can populate the draft before saving as a preset.
- Disable stripe color editing and suppress `stripeColors` output unless the selected effect is stripe-based.
- Seed first-launch starter presets: `rainbow-haze`, `paradise`, and `stripe effects`.
- Add a safe `Test Argument` flow that launches MatrixDesktop windowed with `--no-exit-on-any-key` unless the draft already chooses a conflicting test mode.
- Replace an existing test process when a new test run starts.

## Test Plan

- Build the full solution in Release with Windows targeting enabled.
- Run a JS module syntax check for the configurator UI.
- Publish the framework-dependent Windows x64 folder and confirm both `MatrixDesktop.exe` and `MatrixDesktopConfigurator.exe` are present.
- Smoke test creating, saving, renaming, deleting, and reloading a named preset.
- Smoke test randomizing all three scopes and confirm launch/window controls are unchanged.
- Smoke test the starter presets appear once and remain deleted if the user removes them.
- Smoke test importing an existing command line and saving the imported draft as a preset.
- Smoke test generated commands for palette, stripes, image, mirror/camera, click ripples, windowed, monitor, and topmost settings.
- Smoke test `stripeColors` is disabled and omitted for non-stripe effects, then enabled for `stripes`, `customStripes`, `pride`, `trans`, and `transPride`.
- Smoke test repeated randomization keeps `stripeColors` to 2-8 colors and palettes to 3-6 stops.
- Smoke test the `Test Argument` button replacing the previous test instance.

## Current Verification

- Release solution build passes with 0 warnings and 0 errors.
- Configurator JavaScript syntax check passes.
- Framework-dependent Windows x64 publish includes both `MatrixDesktop.exe` and `MatrixDesktopConfigurator.exe`.
- Smoke zip integrity check passes.

## Follow-up UX Notes

- Implemented launch-control clarification in the configurator:
  - `Borderless all monitors` already spans every display.
  - `Monitor index` is a 0-based target monitor number, not the number of monitors connected.
  - `Monitor index` is disabled unless `Single monitor` is selected.
  - `Use working area` is explained as taskbar-safe bounds and disabled for `Windowed` mode.
- Implemented stripe color dependency:
  - `Stripe colors` is disabled unless the selected effect is stripe-based.
  - Command generation skips `stripeColors` when the effect cannot use it.
- Implemented command import:
  - Paste a full `MatrixDesktop.exe ...` command, raw argument line, query string, or simple batch `start` line.
  - Recognized app/web flags populate the draft and can then be saved as a preset.
  - Command generation ignores monitor and working-area values when their selected window mode cannot use them.

### Add Click Ripples To Rain Effects

Status: Completed; Windows runtime smoke passed

## Summary

Added `clickRipples=true` as a web/query flag so click-triggered ripples can layer onto normal rain effects like `effect=stripes` without using `effect=mirror`. Default click ripple shape is circular, with box, triangle, and star options; the feature is wired for both WebGPU and REGL/WebGL renderers.

Windows visual smoke testing confirmed the click ripple feature works after the triangle ripple was corrected to render as a straight-sided triangle.

Example target command:

```cmd
start "" /min "%EXE%" --hide-cursor font=resurrections fps=30 animationSpeed=0.5 forwardSpeed=0.05 numColumns=220 density=2 effect=stripes renderer=webgpu clickRipples=true stripeColors=0.5,0,0.5,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0.5,0,0.5 raindropLength=0.5 version=3d
```

## Key Changes

- Add web config support for:
  - `clickRipples=true|false`, default `false`.
  - `clickRippleShape=circle|box|triangle|star`, default `circle`; invalid values fall back to `circle`.
- Keep `effect=mirror` behavior unchanged.
- Add click tracking to the rain pass, not the mirror pass, so the ripple brightness feeds into existing downstream effects: stripes, palette, image, etc.
- Track the most recent 5 clicks on the canvas, storing normalized coordinates and elapsed age.
- Add cleanup so click event listeners are removed when the renderer pipeline is destroyed.
- Implement matching shader behavior in:
  - REGL path: `rainPass.effect.frag.glsl`
  - WebGPU path: `rainPass.wgsl`

## Implementation Notes

- Add a small shared JS helper, for example `web/js/clickRipples.js`, that:
  - Attaches a `click` listener to the canvas only when `config.clickRipples` is true.
  - Converts click coordinates to normalized `0..1` canvas space.
  - Exposes fixed-size ripple data for shaders as 5 entries.
  - Provides `cleanup()`.
- Pass `canvas` into both renderer contexts so rain passes can attach canvas-local click handlers.
- In the rain shaders, compute click ripple brightness as an added effect, alongside existing thunder/random ripple logic.
- Use existing ripple defaults for initial tuning:
  - `rippleScale`
  - `rippleSpeed`
  - `rippleThickness`
- Do not expose extra tuning flags in this first pass beyond `clickRipples` and `clickRippleShape`.

## Test Plan

- Build/publish Windows x64 framework-dependent artifact.
- Verify this command renders stripes and produces click ripples without mirror/camera:
  ```cmd
  MatrixDesktop.exe --windowed effect=stripes renderer=webgpu clickRipples=true version=3d
  ```
- Verify WebGPU fallback still works:
  ```cmd
  MatrixDesktop.exe --windowed effect=stripes renderer=webgpu clickRipples=true
  ```
  Expected: WebGPU renders if available; otherwise REGL/WebGL fallback still renders and click ripples work.
- Verify default behavior is unchanged:
  ```cmd
  MatrixDesktop.exe --windowed effect=stripes
  ```
  Expected: no click ripples unless `clickRipples=true`.
- Verify `effect=mirror` still produces its existing click ripple behavior.
- Run static checks already used for this repo: `dotnet build`, JS module parse check, zip integrity check.

## Assumptions

- Click ripples should apply to all non-mirror rain effects, not only stripes.
- Circular ripples are the default.
- Existing random/time-based preset ripples remain unchanged.
- `v0.1.0` remains as-is; this feature should land in a new commit and can be tagged separately if released.
